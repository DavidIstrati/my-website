I'm no stranger to the world of developing, starting from Grade 7! I've worked as a data scientist since Grade 10, founded Measure, worked as a freelancer, won multiple hackathons and Kaggle medals, and most recently, served as a data engineer at Soleadify. Now, I'm excited to put all that experience to use to build the amazing ProductSpark! I'm ready to continue my mission of technology democratization.",
